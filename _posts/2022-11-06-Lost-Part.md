Good morning.

I was tired yesterday, after helping my father set up our generator. It was more okay than not. I enjoyed the whole process because I have a vision of what I and my father are working towards. 

I realized that I perform better if I know what we are working on.

Which leads us to my current situation. I am always feeling tired. Always feel like running out of  energy. I don't know, maybe I'm just burned out and I don't have the common symptoms?

I am also doing many things none of which guarantees my future. 

This whole "not knowing the end thing" keeps me from progressing knowledge on Calculus and Chemistry. It's just, WHAT ARE THOSE FOR? Never explained. I want to know why! Why! Why! Why!
