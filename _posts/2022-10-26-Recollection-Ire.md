Today, there were no face to face classes. I saved money. Guess that makes up for what happened yesterday. 

Yesterday, I left for the recollection at around 10:40 AM. A little late thanusual ut still early for my ETA which is ALWAYS 2 hours after departure, which is 12:40.
The registration for the recollection starts at 12:00 and ends at 1:00 AM. So that means my ETA still falls inside the given time, right?

In comes the two bridges that connects Carmona to GMA and GMA to Dasmari√±as. Out of all 4 lanes for each bridge, there were only 2 lanes and 1 lane open respectively. That SEVERELY delayed my time. It was also raining. Just think how much of a delay, the traffic and rain brought to me. The jeep I boarded after thevan ride even got the audacity to gas up! It's like I ised all the bad luck points I have yesterday. Everything that could go wrong went wrong!

I arrived at 12:30. Too late for the registrations. I was the 6th one late. The others were from EEE and IEE. It's infuriating. I understand that I cannot disturb the peace that has been going on for 25 minutes now, but the person who had to sit us down around the chairs had to explain hat we cannot enter anymore. Honestly,I cannot understand the fact that we cannot enter anymore. I feel like the words that he was saying through the lines were, "Be early next time. This is just a lesson to arrive early".

But I did nothing wrong did I? I was just unofrtunate enough that the traffic occurred badly that way. I'm still salty about that one. I will never forget about that instance. I will never. At this point, I am being slowly left out of our block, event by event. What's more irritating is that I have to sign up for another schedule for a Special Recollection, perhaps alongside other latecomers who were made to turn back. What was that? I left home yesterday just to... do a round trip? I lost a total of 260 and 8 hours. 

I lost all that to the public transport situation here. The traffic on the return route prompted the van to take another route into Silang that comes out of Nuvali. 

From now on, I will leave home 3 hours ahead of any class instead of the usual 2 hour allotment. I am angered by this and vow to never let this happen again.
