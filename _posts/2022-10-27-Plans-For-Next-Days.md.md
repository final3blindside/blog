Tooth Extraction got postponed for today. Rescheduled for tomorrow.

I had just finished doing my Enabling Assessment in Chemistry. It was an easy one. I wish I could say the the same about the other assessments from other subjects.

Looking at my handwritten to-do list now, the only deadlines tomorrow would be the Enabling Assessment in Applied Engineering Mathematics. I have done two attempts already and haven't perfected it yet. There are unlimited attempts, so I would definitely try again tomorrow. Aside from that, the next deadline would be on Saturday. One is about a 2 week log for circuit exercises in PE. The otherone is a group work in Psychology related to having our own interpretations of a slogan and turning it into an artwork. 

And then the Halloween Party event on 31. I already told my mother that I do not want to handle that. It is stressful enough to decorate the house for that, it would be more stressful interacting with kids.
