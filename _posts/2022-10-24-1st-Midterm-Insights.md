I am writing this after submitting two more Enabling Assessments, kind of an aftershock of the earthquake that is the Midterms. 
They were from Calculus (Enabling Assessment) and PE ( A 2-week workout plan).

After a week mixed with stagnancy and procrastination, I can only say that I barely survived. 

I was lucky to have been exempted from the Applied Engineering Math Midterms, all thanks to my Math Wizard teammates, Jethroe and Mika, who carried the team to victory. We are going to the Finals on Thursday, November 17, 2022.

Because if I hadn't been exempted, I would have failed two midterm exams... The other one? Calculus 1.

I thought I studied enough, but I guess my study sessions watching Organic Chemistry Tutor till midnight didn't pay off as I would have wanted it to be. I was 80% confident when I entered the examination room at CTH Building. I came out questioning how I survived high school with this brain level. The test was a mixture of multiple choice questions and problem solving. I am confident on the 20-item, 40-point multiple choice portion, but when it comes to the Problem solving? All hell broke loose. I barely answered all three. I have an answer for all questions, but I won't guarantee that they'd get full points. I did those for the sake of receiving points for my solutions as our professor told us she would be giving points for the solution as well.

It took me two attempts to perfect the UTS Midterm Exam, I have 4 mistakes in MMW, 8 mistakes in Chemistry Lecture, and a 47/65 in Chemistry Lab. REED was all about reflecting about songs and videos provided, I had full points in Computer Aided Drafting. I love the subject. I even used my sister's laptop to download AutoCAD. Hers is faster. I am actually writing this from said laptop. It's faster than mine.

Overall, I would rate my Midterm Exams performance a 5/10. It's not good, not bad, but one crucial mistake or advantage can set the stage for the failure I am dreading. Did I mention a scholarship rests on my grades? I need to bounce back this final term. I need more fuel. I need more thrust. But most of all, I need more time. The world is moving too fast for me and I need to create time out of nowhere.

See you next time,
Yancey
