I am lost. I may have been spreading myself too thin. I do not feel that I have been contributing enough in my NSTP group.

There is so many to explore and I feel like I am losing ground on everything. It always feels like I have to stay focused all of the time because if I do lose focus, I lose all knowledge I have learned.

Or, again, I may have been spreading myself too thin. I have to enroll for another Practical Driving Course this month! Pressure is piling up! Temperature is rising! There are two scenarios here. I break or I become a diamond. 

A thought I had earlier morning and for the past days already:
"The older we get, the more we want to be quiet. But the older we get, the bigger our ambitions become."

It is hard to spread yourself too thin. You lose track of everything and it'll be too late to recover. I need to plan every single thing. From now on. Did I mention that I was going to apply for a driver's license? ah, man.
