I feel like hitting a roadblock. Just because the last face to face classes for this year happened yesterday. My knees just gave out on me. Seriously, I always feel as if they are smoking or worn out. I badly need to get that license next month, or any time between this January to March, since my student license expires on April.

Anyway, a quick recap of what happened recently.
