Today was laundry day. There was nothing much happening today, except the usual. We didn't go out today either.

Here are the events, thoughts and things I remember or have been bottling up since last time.
# Thoughts After Christmas

## Cicada 3301 in the Philippines?
A post on [a freedom wall](https://web.facebook.com/hashtag/dlsudfw_2790) reminded me of the Cicada 3301 puzzle. I remember hurriedly borrowing my sister's laptop and trying to extract details from the picture using [boxentriq](https://www.boxentriq.com/). I gave up after an hour, because Mom si already giving me the side eyes, and I was supposed to be helping my sister cook and prepare food for tomorrow (25). I will try tinkering with it again these next few days.

## Care Patrol - Finance Team Duties (NSTP)
With only two members on that team, I am single-handedly trying to make this team function. The other team member is an irregular student who isn't cooperating that much with the rest of the group. Especially me. I am the only person who needs to directly work with him, therefore, I need his help and support. 

He doesn't respond to Messages fast. Nor does he seem like cooperating.

Hence, I took the responsibility of the whole team as my own. I am now in charge of the group's budget, and a financial report. While I do not heavily need his support, I know that his inactivity will become an issue down the line. Especially with meticulous groupmates/friends in the group, he surely won't pass easily. 

I need to do that report ASAP. Donations are already coming in!
