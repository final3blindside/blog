Today was laundry day. There was nothing much happening today, except the usual. We didn't go out today either.

Here are the events, thoughts and things I remember or have been bottling up since last time.
# Thoughts After Christmas

## Cicada 3301 in the Philippines?
A post on [a freedom wall](https://web.facebook.com/hashtag/dlsudfw_2790) reminded me of the Cicada 3301 puzzle. I remember hurriedly borrowing my sister's laptop and trying to extract details from the picture using [boxentriq](https://www.boxentriq.com/). I gave up after an hour, because Mom si already giving me the side eyes, and I was supposed to be helping my sister cook and prepare food for tomorrow (25). I will try tinkering with it again these next few days.

## Care Patrol - Finance Team Duties (NSTP)
With only two members on that team, I am single-handedly trying to make this team function. The other team member is an irregular student who isn't cooperating that much with the rest of the group. Especially me. I am the only person who needs to directly work with him, therefore, I need his help and support. 

He doesn't respond to Messages fast. Nor does he seem like cooperating.

Hence, I took the responsibility of the whole team as my own. I am now in charge of the group's budget, and a financial report. While I do not heavily need his support, I know that his inactivity will become an issue down the line. Especially with meticulous groupmates/friends in the group, he surely won't pass easily. 

I need to do that report ASAP. Donations are already coming in!

## Microsoft Student Learn Ambassador Application
I just need to complete a video and an essay to progress with the application. I may or may not have been a very ambitious guy.

## Github Campus Student Campus Expert Application.
Welp. Even someone better than me won't apply until 2024. I will still try to apply though. Because, why not? Applications will open this February. This means I have a full month in January to improve my GitHub/Programming skills.

## Understanding the Self - Audio Skit
This has been lingering in my mind since the start of the Christmas vacation. It invovles formulating an original story that focuses on the topics we discussed this semester. I feel burdened because my groupmates know me as a writer. I feel like they are banking on me to form a story ASAP. Not just that, but it needs to be told only through audio. I need to start doing this as well ASAP.

## C and Python learning
I have been learning both these languages consistently for a while now. I am sure I will be needing them in our future years as an Engineering major. I have heard thatw e will work with the Arduino and the Raspberry Pis. Looking forward to those times actually!

But not only that, I am learning them as well because I plan on being serious now on Competitive Programming and having technical knowledge appropriate for startups and internships. Knowledge is still the key in the 21st century! Knowledge is key, and data is gold!

## IECEP Code 1.0, 2.0, 3.0
