# We lost the Nationals
 The score ended in:
 *TUP Manila - 110 points
 *CvSU Indang - 100 points
 *DLSU-D - 90 points
 *CSU - 90 points
 *SLU - 90 points
 *PLM - 90 points

 We lost the clincher as well, relegating us to a shared P5/P6 with CSU, SLU snatching 3rd.

# Our seniors lost as well
 The winner in their category was DLSU Manila. Our team garnered 10 points as compared to DLSU Manila's 90. These results of our university made me buy 3 books in Electronics Engineering and Engineering Mathematics even if we don't have those lessons yet in our first and second years. I guess it is a good start. I am now officially a quizzer, and most likely would be participating again next year. I have tasted the Nationals, I am now hungry to taste something better... perhaps a podium finish?

 # I chased after my deadlines this week.
  Of course, being a quizzer, doing these extracurricular activities on the side can take a toll on your scheduling or time. I was lucky enough to catch up on my AutoCAD and MMW deadlines yesterday and today. Now that the contests are over, I have now returned to being a normal student. My deadlines are now in check, and I am now nervous about my grades. They will be released today. My lowest grade is in Calculus: a harrowing 3.00 or 86.4%. 

  I really need to turn this Bounceback Week into a Bounceback Finals. I need to perfect my Final Term in Calculus if I want that to rise up still.

  # I am proud of having recreated an AutoCAD activity all by myself
   This is the same activity that has the deadline that I chased through the fields. I was literally a minute away from the deadline and two minutes late on my second attempt (Because why not)
