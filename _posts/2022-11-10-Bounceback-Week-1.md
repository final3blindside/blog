On Monday, I attended online class only.
On Tuesday, I went to school to supposedly review for the Nationals. The AutoCAD Activity was quite hard for me. It was about layering and dimensioning.
On Wednesday, I bought a PE uniform and I attended a famli member's funeral.

Today, I will start to focus more. The Nationals is just around the corner, a good 5 days away.
